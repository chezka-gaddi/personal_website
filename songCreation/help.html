      <h2>CSS Modifications</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <h3 class="clickable-heading">Header Background Image</h3>
        <span>
          The header background image is a video with an image backup if the video is not able to render. The text is
          edited using the &lth1&gtHeading 1&lt/h1&gt header tag to have the color of white and a different font from
          the rest of the page.
        </span>

        <h3 class="clickable-heading">Navigation Bar</h3>
        <span>
          The navigation bar is created by editing an undordered list with hyperlink text to navigate from one page to
          another. When a link is active or is hovered over, the background color changes to indicate the interaction.
        </span>

        <h3 class="clickable-heading">Content Layout</h3>
        <span>
          Two different layouts are used to create the website. For the index, a two column layout is created to divide
          the area where the music sheet resides and the area for the interactive buttons. This layout has the ability
          to restructure to have the contents to be stacked when the window is smaller than a certain value.
          <div>
            <div class="column left border">Left Column</div>
            <div class="column right border">Right Column</div>
          </div>
          The files management page and the help page is formatted using a simple vertical layout that stacks sections
          on top of each other.
          <div>
            <div class="content border">Section 1</div>
            <div class="content border">Section 2</div>
          </div>
        </span>

        <h3 class="clickable-heading">Buttons</h3>
        <span>
          The buttons used in the program has mutiple styling applied to them. Upon hovering on a button, the cursor
          changes to a pointer and a shadow affect is applied to indicate the button in focus. Styling is also applied
          to buttons that are disbaled to have a more muted background and the cursor is changed to not-allowed. <br />
          <button>Example</button> <button disabled>Disabled Button</button>
        </span>

      <h2>How to Use</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <h3 class="clickable-heading">Creating a Song</h3>
        <span>
          The piano is is the source of the main interaction buttons. Keys that are pressed are read into the music
          sheet as a gray note indicating that it is a temporary note and must be confirmed to move on the next note.
          You are able to change the note as many times as you like and the undo/redo command can iterate through all
          the changes of the temporary note. <br />
          When confirmed, the note turns black and when the keys are pressed again, a gray note is appended after the
          black note. At each confirmation, the history of the temporary note is deleted and past changes on the
          temporary notes are no longer available. The undo/redo commands are now only available for the black notes.
          <br />
          You are able to play what is currently written on the music sheet (including temporary notes) with <button><i
              class="fas fa-play"></i></button> The play speed can also be doubled when the switch is activated.
        </span>

        <h3 class="clickable-heading">Saving a Song</h3>
        <span>
          You are able to change the name of your composition using the text box and it will take that name to name the
          xml file written when you click <button>&#128190; Save</button>
        </span>

        <h3 class="clickable-heading">Uploading a Song</h3>

          upload to the server and clicking <button>&#10514; Upload</button> would submit the file to be uploaded. After
          a successful upload, the file can be seen inside the combo box that lists out all of the files currently on
          the server.
        </span>

        <h3 class="clickable-heading">Loading a Song</h3>
        <span>

          activate the dropdown option, selecting the song you would like to load and clicking <button>Load
            Song</button>
          The other option requires you to navigate to the files management page. Choose a song you would like to
          interact with from the combo box and click the <button>Load</button> That would then send you the home page
          with the song displayed on the music sheet. You are able to interact with the current song by adding more
          notes to the selection or playing it using the <button><i class="fas fa-play"></i></button>
        </span>
